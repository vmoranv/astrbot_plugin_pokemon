# backend/core/game_logic.py

# This module orchestrates calls to services to manage game flow.
# It should not contain direct database access or complex calculations.

# Example:
# async def start_new_game(player_id: str, player_name: str):
#     """Orchestrates the process of starting a new game for a player."""
#     from backend.services.player_service import PlayerService # Import services here
#     player_service = PlayerService()
#     await player_service.create_player(player_id, player_name)
#     # Potentially add a starter pokemon, place player in start location, etc.
#     # await player_service.add_pokemon_to_player(...)
#     # await player_service.update_player_location(...)
#     pass

# async def process_command(player_id: str, command: str, args: list):
#     """Orchestrates the processing of a player command."""
#     # This might be handled more directly by commands.command_handler,
#     # but complex command sequences could be managed here.
#     pass

# Add other game flow orchestration functions
