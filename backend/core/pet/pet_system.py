    # This is pure calculation logic based on the Pokemon's data and Race data.
    # It should use the formulas defined in core.battle.formulas.

    # Assuming calculate_stats function exists in core.battle.formulas
    # This function should take Pokemon and Race objects and return a dictionary of stats.
    # The calculate_stats function itself will use the Pokemon's level, IVs, EVs, Nature,
    # and the Race's base stats.

    # The calculate_stats function is already assumed to be called during level_up.
    # This function can simply return the currently calculated stats stored on the Pokemon object,
    # or recalculate them if needed (e.g., if IVs/EVs changed).
    # For simplicity, let's assume the stats attribute on the Pokemon object is kept up-to-date
    # by functions like level_up, and this function just returns it.
    # If stats can change dynamically (e.g., in battle due to stat stages),
    # a separate function might be needed to get *battle* stats.
    # This function is likely for displaying stats outside of battle.

    # Let's ensure the stats are calculated if they aren't already (e.g., after loading from DB)
    if not pokemon.stats:
         pokemon.stats = calculate_stats(pokemon, race_data)

# Add other general pet system functions (e.g., calculate_happiness, manage_abilities)
