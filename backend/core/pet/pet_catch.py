async def calculate_catch_success(pokemon: Pokemon, pokeball: Item) -> bool:

    Calculates if a wild pokemon is successfully caught using a pokeball.

    """
    # This is pure logic based on the Pokemon's current state (HP, status)
    # and the Pokeball's properties (catch rate modifier).
    # The actual catch rate formula is complex and should be in core.battle.formulas.

    # Example workflow:
    # 1. Get the base catch rate of the pokemon's species (this should be part of the Pokemon model or passed in via Race data).
    #    base_catch_rate = pokemon.race.base_catch_rate # Assuming base_catch_rate is on Race model

    # 2. Calculate the modified catch rate based on HP, status effects, and pokeball modifier.
    #    Assuming calculate_catch_rate function exists in core.battle.formulas
    #    modified_catch_rate = calculate_catch_rate(pokemon, pokeball)

    # 3. Perform the catch attempt calculation.
    #    This typically involves generating a random number and comparing it to the modified catch rate.
    #    The exact method varies by Pokemon generation, but a common approach involves calculating a "shake probability".
    #    Let's use a simplified probability check for MVP.

    # Simplified placeholder logic:
    # Factors affecting catch rate:
    # - Pokemon's base catch rate (higher is easier)
    # - Pokemon's current HP (lower is easier)
    # - Pokemon's status effect (sleep/freeze easier, paralysis/poison/burn slightly easier)
    # - Pokeball's catch rate modifier (e.g., Great Ball 1.5x, Ultra Ball 2x)

    # Assume pokemon has attributes like current_hp, max_hp, status_effect
    # Assume pokeball has an attribute like catch_modifier

    # Very simplified probability calculation:
    # Probability = (base_catch_rate / 255) * (max_hp / current_hp) * pokeball_modifier * status_modifier
    # This is NOT the actual Pokemon formula, just a simplified example.

    # Let's assume calculate_catch_rate returns a single probability value (0.0 to 1.0)
    # based on all factors.
    catch_probability = calculate_catch_rate(pokemon, pokeball) # Call the formula function

    # Generate a random number between 0.0 and 1.0
    random_roll = random.random()

    logger.debug(f"Catch attempt for {pokemon.nickname} with {pokeball.name}. Probability: {catch_probability:.2f}, Roll: {random_roll:.2f}")

    # If the random roll is less than the catch probability, the pokemon is caught.
    is_caught = random_roll < catch_probability

    return is_caught

# Add other catch related functions if needed (e.g., apply_status_effect_for_catch)
